OVERVIEW:

  Challenges the user to travel from one corner of the grid to the second corner of the grid and
  "stepping" on as few mines as possible.


INCLUDED FILES:

 README - this file
 MineWalker.java - driver class
 MineWalkerPanel.java - main class files
 RandomWalk.java - inherited methods


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 All project files should be in the same directory.

 From the directory containing the .java source code, compile the following programs:
    $ javac MineWalker.java
    $ javac MineWalkerPanel.java
    $ javac RandomWalk.java

 Run the program from the directory containing each of the .class files:
    $ java MineWalker

 The program then extends the JPanel and the game begins.

 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 In this program, I implement a huge series of nested if statements in order
 to fulfill the necessary conditionals within my program. For example, in order for
 the program to detect where the next click is allowed, I used a series of if statements to
 detect if the place clicked was one that was one tile away from the previous, otherwise, clicking
 was not allowed.
 
 The purpose of the RandomWalk class is to create a path on the grid that no mines will appear on.
 Since I use a random number generator, I had to put limits on where the mines actually appear on
 the grid. 
 
 The improvements I would need to make on this program involve organization with the code;
 considering the length of the code, I would have liked to clean it up a little more than
 the current status.


PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

 Despite the countless hours of rage and hair-pulling, my program was completed with success
 and I am very proud of what I have created. Considering the work I put into the code, I enjoy
 the outcome. The only issue I could not fix unfortunately, was the blinking 'X' that should be
 wherever the current spot is. I tried for a long time and worked with a partner to try and solve
 the problem, but to no avail.
 
 The program took a lot of guess and check in testing and quite a few system.out's to make sure that
 the program was getting to the certain code I was testing. Fortunately, I didn't get many errors when
 building this program. What happened instead was things doing what they were not supposed to be doing.
 This was eventually fixed. 
 
 The most frustrating thing about this project and perhaps one of the most frustrating things
 in the history of my educational career, was when I could not locate the bracket that was lost somewhere
 in the abyss of code. Scanning for a seeming infinite amount of time through 700+ lines of code to 
 find where that ONE BRACKET was misplaced, or missing. After finding it a took a good, long break to
 cool off. But the struggle makes the reward all that better! 

 
EXTRA CREDIT: (only necessary if you did available extra credit)

 I put the slider on the panel but never implemented it :'(
