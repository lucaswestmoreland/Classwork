Initial Observations:
  As I began coding the ConvertToSeconds program, I had to think of a way to
  effectively code something that could do the math easily for anyone needing
  to add together all of the seconds and do the conversions with out needing to
  do it in their head.
  
  With the ConvertToHours program, I had to encorporate the mod "%" expression to
  evaulate the remainder of the hours and use that to get the value in minutes and
  then later, seconds. I feel I may have used too many variables however I see no
  other way to write that code.
  
Description:
  This program will ask the user to input the hours, minutes, and seconds they
  wish to convert to seconds. The program then multiplies the hours by 3600,
  the minutes by 60, and the seconds by 1. It then adds all of the values together
  and then prints out "The total number of seconds is equal to x seconds."
  
  The ConvertToHours program will ask the user to input the amount of seconds
  and then the program will give them the total amount of hours, minutes, and 
  seconds. This program also gives the user the values of seconds in a fractional
  hours values.
  
Errors:
  My first error happened to be a missing ";" which gave a compiling error.
  This was easily fixed.
  
  Next came an error in what was being outputted. The code was able to 
  be compiled however my output was missing a space before "seconds" 
  making the println display "...equal to 4860seconds."
  
  When writing the ConvertToHours.java program, I was so focused on making
  sure the output was pretty, that I left out a couple of concatenations
  giving me a compilier error. I quickly fixed these issues by adding "+"
  into the missing spots on my println.
