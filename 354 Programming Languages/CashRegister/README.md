Project 1: Cash Register
7 September 2016


Submission Details:

 In submitting this program, I didn't know exactly what files were required
 in the final submission so I just included all of the files that were generated
 by Visual Studio. 

Code Details:

 I really enjoyed writing the code for this project because the GUI that
 comes with Visual Studio is very satisfying as opposed to things like VIM 
 and even eclipse. 

 In the design portion of the program, there was a problem that involved 
 numerous methods "spawning" into my source code whenever I would click
 on the new items in the design. If I tried deleting said methods, the design
 would bug out and would not let me continue, so I chose to leave them in.

 I did not find a reason to implement any kind of storage system for a 
 item object that could be saved, because my GUI displayed all of the necessary
 values and if a customer were to hypothetically use this program, they would
 most likely not need any more information than what is given.

Java vs. C# comparison:

 C# seems to be much more user friendly and almost as if anyone could program
 with it (this might be the GUI but still). The way the methods work is nearly
 identical which I like, because I am fimiliar with Java. 

 Another thing I noticed was that with C#, there is a much more helpful support
 group on the internet that allowed me to troubleshoot much faster than if I 
 were to program in C or Java.

Conclusion:

 This was an enjoyable project to do. In fact, I can't remember the last time 
 a program that I wrote was even remotely enjoyable. With that being said, I 
 wish I knew why the methods wouldn't delete and a little bit more of a
 description on how to submit the project.
