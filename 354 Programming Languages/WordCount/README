Python Project:

 Off the bat, when writing this program, I immediately noticed many convenient functions that were a little easier to implement
 than the Java counterpart would have been. For example, there is no need to specify variable type in python, which I thought was
 weird yet handy. Adding a dictionary that can hold any type of variable is much nicer than having a type specific array in Java.
 The learning curve of Python was not as bad as I anticipated, however it was weird adjusting to it since I don't have a breadth of 
 language knowledge other than a few. Online support for the tasks I was attempting to accomplish was very helpful. 
 
 In addition, it seems as though python integrates the literal English language in the programming language itself. At surface, it
 seems as though python is much more flexible than Java. As far as readability, Python is very handy in the way it forces you to properly
 indent your code (it won't run if not properly indented). Obviously Java has been around much longer than Python, but I think with more 
 time, Python will overcome the popularity of Java.
 
 The version of Python I'm using is 3.5, which hopefully doesn't cause any problems with grading.
