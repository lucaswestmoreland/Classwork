#Project 4
Name: Lucas Westmoreland
Class: CS253

##Overview

 This assignment was a simple Makefile used to compile the main.c file into a program called 'hello'.

##Compiling and Using

 At the command line in the main directory:

 $make (compiles the main.c into hello)

 	OR

 $make hello (same as 'make')

	OR

 $make clean (removes the generated files that were created during build process)

	OR

 $make run (builds the program and then executes it)

##Testing

 Only testing done was trying 'make' 'make run' and 'make clean' in the console, and making 
 sure it works.

##Discussion

 This project was only a little puzzling when it came to getting the exactly correct syntax.
 Other than that, it was no problem.

##Sources used

 Referenced the in class example on Makefiles.
