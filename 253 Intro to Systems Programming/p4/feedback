Hey Lucas, 


Your README discussion section is lacking just a bit. Hard to give you the full 100% when other students fully followed the template, providing very specific problems with specific solutions. You DONT have to write a lot to get a 100% on these sections, for instance the following is a concise example that I would give full credit for:

BUG #1 DISCOVERED:      gcc hello.c hello -o
THE ISSUE:              incorrect ordering of gcc options, -o needs to be before the object file it re-names
MY SOLUTION:            gcc hello.c -o hello

BUG #2 DISCOVERED:
...
...


Good job with using the correct dependency here ->
hello: main.o
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@


Cheers,
-Joey.
