#Project 5
Author: Lucas Westmoreland
Class: CS253 Section 2

##Overview

This program is a shell script that runs the application made from linking a linked list to a small test file.

##Compiling and Using

Compile this program using the Makefile:

 $ make

After that, run the program:

 $ ./backpack.sh <output file>

##Testing

Since I was able to model this shell script after the format of the given shell scripts, the formatting of the code was
pretty easy so the testing was done by seeing the effects of the new things I added. Basically, if I didn't see the
output I expected, I would check the syntax of the code against the given shell scripts.
 
##Discussion

In writing this program, I began to understand the effectiveness of writing shell scripts. This project was pretty easy
because there were a lot of resources given to us whether it be in program examples, or in class examples.
