#Project 1

##Overview

This program takes in text from the standard input that counts the 
number of words, lines, characters, and digits and prints the results
to the standard output. 

##Compiling and Using

Make sure all the files are in the same directory then:

	$ make 
	$ ./homework < data (or any text file)

##Discussion

The biggest issue that I encountered while writing this program was navigation
through the console. Setting everything up to be able to write this program on my machine
was very time consuming but through Piazza and some tinkering, I was able to figure out
the basic necessities for writing this program.

Another issue arose when I had to fit the exact format of the grader. Writing the printf
portion of the program required me to copy the output of the grader.

Things started clicking for me when I ended up giving up on writing it in Cygwin and
started writing it in MobaXTerm.

##Sources used

The source I used was from the cs253 examples that were given to us.
