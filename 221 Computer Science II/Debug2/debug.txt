Changes:

 1.) The conditional in the while loop of the remove method
 was incorrect giving us an ArrayOutOfBoundsException. This was
 happening because the while loop wasn't getting touched by the 
 program.

 2.) The boolean method return value was impossible to achieve as
 rear < 0, so I changed the return to rear == 0.

 3.) We finally changed the updater on rear in the add method from
 rear-- to rear++ because when you are adding to an array, you need 
 to move the rear further up the array.
