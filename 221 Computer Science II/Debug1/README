DebuggerTest2:
 In searching for the error, I began by running the program to get a 
 null pointer exception. In my experience with these errors, I determined
 that there was a point in time within the code, that something was trying
 to "point" to a value that didn't exist. Correct implementation of the 
 breakpoints led me to an unnecessary '=' sign within the for loop.
 
FindRoute:
 In scanning over the original code, I immediately noticed a semi-colon
 after the while loop. I didn't really need to use the debugger to see this.

Car:
 After this bug, I moved over to the Car class to find what was wrong with
 the NextMove() method. I placed a breakpoint at the beginning of the method
 and began running through the method. I actually ended up finding the error
 by observing that the i--, and the i++ were switched around for the EAST and 
 WEST directions. The program now runs with no errors.
